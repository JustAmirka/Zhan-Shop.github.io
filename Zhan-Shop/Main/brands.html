   <p><strong>YVES SAINT LAURENT</strong>

Yves Saint Laurent, also known as Saint Laurent, is a French luxury fashion house founded by Yves Saint Laurent and his partner, Pierre Bergé. The company revived its haute couture collection in 2015 under former Creative Director Hedi Slimane. In April 2016, Anthony Vaccarello was appointed as Creative Director. Founded in 1962, today Saint Laurent markets a range of women's and men's ready-to-wear products, leather goods, shoes and jewellery. Yves Saint Laurent Beauté also has a presence in the beauty and fragrance market, although this is owned by L'Oréal, which holds exclusive licenses for the name.</p>

   <p><strong>KILIAN PARIS</strong>

     In 2007, Kilian founded the eponymous brand, striving not only to realize his creativity, but also to achieve harmony between elegance and flashy luxury. Each Kilian bottle can be reused an unlimited number of times. Largely due to this unique philosophy of "sustainable luxury", the brand quickly became incredibly popular and took its own niche in the world of perfumery. In 2007, Kilian launched a collection of fragrances under his own name, in which he achieves a harmonious combination of sophistication, elegance and absolute uncompromising luxury. And his “eco-luxe” principle, which is that perfume bottles can be refilled many times and stored for many years, minimally polluting the planet, instantly raised his brand to the top of the perfumery Olympus, and provided him with his own “niche” in this area.</p>

  		<p><strong>DIOR</strong>
The House of Dior was established on 16 December 1946 at 30 Avenue Montaigne in Paris. However, the current Dior corporation celebrates "1947" as the opening year. Dior was financially backed by wealthy businessman Marcel Boussac. Boussac had originally invited Dior to design for Philippe et Gaston, but Dior refused, wishing to make a fresh start under his own name rather than reviving an old brand. The new couture house became a part of "a vertically integrated textile business" already operated by Boussac. Its capital was at FFr 6 million and workforce at 80 employees. The company was really a vanity project for Boussac and was a "majorly owned affiliate of Boussac Saint-Freres S.A. Nevertheless, Dior was allowed a then-unusual great part in his namesake label despite Boussac's reputation as a "control freak". Dior's creativity also negotiated him a good salary.</p>

   <p><strong>TOM FORD</strong>
Tom Ford departed his position as creative director at Gucci in 2004 and founded his own eponymous label in April 2005. The Tom Ford retail brand concept, described as the first true luxury brand of the 21st century, began in 2004 as a venture between Ford and his business partner Domenico de Sole with the launch of a cosmetics line. In the same year, Ford announced his partnership with Marcolin Group to produce and distribute optical frames and sunglasses. In 2005, he launched the Tom Ford Estée Lauder Collection of cosmetics.</p>

  		<p><strong>GIVENCHY</strong>

In 1952, Hubert de Givenchy founded his own luxury house and launched a new collection Les Séparables with some floaty skirts and puffy blouses made from raw cotton. Givenchy achieved critical acclaim with Vogue magazine praising his "wonderful first collection". The collection included the Bettina Blouse a white shirt named in honour of Bettina Graziani, which was then painted in one of René Gruau's works. The New York Times magazine published an article entitled "A Star Is Born" and l’Album du Figaro also wrote a feature stating that "In one night, Hubert de Givenchy became one of fashion’s most famous children with his first collection." Models such as Suzy Parker and Dorian Leigh became muses of the house. In terms of innovation, he used 'shirting', a raw cotton similar to pattern paper, to create his chic and casual collections. In 1954, Hubert de Givenchy presented the first shirt dress. He was the first high fashion designer to create a luxury ready-to-wear clothing line, called "Givenchy Université", which was produced in Paris using machinery imported from the United States. Before he was able to sign for this new collection, Hubert de Givenchy bought all the shares of his fashion house back from Louis Fontaine.</p>
